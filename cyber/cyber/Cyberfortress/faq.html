                <h2 class="section-title">General Questions</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What is CyberFortress?</h3>
                    <p>CyberFortress is an autonomous security platform that combines threat detection, automated
                        response, deception, and immutable audit capabilities in a single unified platform.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What makes CyberFortress different from existing SIEM/SOAR tools?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Behavioral correlation across domains:</strong> We correlate network, endpoint, and
                        identity data using graph neural networks to detect attack chains. Traditional SIEMs correlate
                        within domains but miss cross-domain attacks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Autonomous detection:</strong> Our ML models reduce false positives to <1% compared to
                            30-50% for rule-based SIEMs.</p>
                            <p><strong>Policy-driven automation:</strong> Response actions execute automatically with
                                human oversight, reducing MTTR by 85%.</p>
                            <p><strong>Immutable audit:</strong> Blockchain-backed audit trails provide tamper-proof
                                evidence for compliance and forensics.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Is this an EDR replacement?</h3>
                            <p>No. CyberFortress complements EDR by correlating endpoint alerts with network and
                                identity data. We integrate with leading EDR solutions (CrowdStrike, Carbon Black,
                                SentinelOne) rather than replacing them.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Is this a SIEM replacement?</h3>
                            <p>Partially. CyberFortress provides threat detection and correlation superior to
                                traditional SIEMs, but we're not a general-purpose log management platform. Many
                                customers use CyberFortress for security detection and keep their SIEM for compliance
                                logging and long-term retention.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Technical Questions</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>What data does CyberFortress collect?</h3>
                    <p>CyberFortress collects network flow data (NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX), endpoint telemetry (via EDR
                        integrations or eBPF agents), authentication logs (from IAM systems), and security tool alerts
                        (from SIEM, firewall, etc.). We do NOT collect full packet captures or PII without explicit
                        customer configuration.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What is the performance overhead?</h3>
                    <p>eBPF-based edge agents have <1% CPU overhead. Network tap deployments have zero performance
                            impact on production systems. Cloud-based processing eliminates on-premise infrastructure
                            requirements for SaaS deployments.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>How does behavioral baselining work?</h3>
                            <p>CyberFortress observes normal activity for 7-14 days to establish baselines for user
                                behavior, network patterns, and application interactions. ML models then detect
                                deviations from these baselines. Baselines adapt over time as your environment evolves.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Can I customize detection rules?</h3>
                            <p>Yes. While our ML models handle most detection, you can create custom rules using our
                                Python-based plugin framework. You can also adjust sensitivity thresholds for existing
                                detections.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>How accurate is the detection?</h3>
                            <p>Our false positive rate is <1% based on production deployments. This is 30-50x better
                                    than rule-based SIEMs. However, accuracy depends on environment-specific factors
                                    (network complexity, baseline quality, etc.).</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Deployment Questions</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>How long does deployment take?</h3>
                    <p><strong>SaaS:</strong> Agent installation: <1 day. Integration setup: <1 week. Baselining: 1-2
                            weeks. Total time to production: 3-4 weeks.</p>
                            <p><strong>On-premise:</strong> Infrastructure setup: 1-2 weeks. Agent installation: <1 day.
                                    Integration setup: 1 week. Baselining: 1-2 weeks. Total time to production: 4-6
                                    weeks.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>What are the infrastructure requirements?</h3>
                                    <p>For SaaS deployments, no on-premise infrastructure required (agents only). For
                                        on-premise deployments, see our deployment documentation for detailed specs.
                                        Minimum: 16 cores, 64 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>Do you support air-gapped networks?</h3>
                                    <p>Yes. On-premise deployment supports fully air-gapped environments with offline
                                        model updates delivered via secure file transfer.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>Can I start with a POC?</h3>
                                    <p>Yes. We offer 30-day proof of concept deployments for qualified customers. POC
                                        includes full platform access, integration support, and dedicated SE resources.
